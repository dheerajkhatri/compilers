 Assignments

    You will be designing a language and building a compiler for it in this course. This task will be broken down into a series of assignments. Your compiler is required to generate MIPS code which can be run on a MIPS simulator.
    The language you design must have the following features
        Global declarations for both functions and variables
        Usual mathematical expressions (bracketing, +, -, *, /, unary negation)
        Have Integers and Boolean types
        Looping options
        Conditionals
        Should allow all kinds of nesting.
        Type checking.
        Input/Output commands
        Recursion.
        
        
    Assignment 01 Due on Jan 20th
    Write a C program to do the following:
    Input: A regular expression on the alphabet {a,b}.
    Output: The minimal DFA for the regular expression

    In addition, you must write a program to simulate the DFA on any possible input.
    
    
    Assignment 02 Due on Feb 9th
    Write the grammar(tentative) for the language you've designed. The language you've designed should be presented at     a .txt or .pdf file. Identify the tokens. Write a lex code which will produce the tokens for your language.
    
    Assignment 03 Due on March 24th
    
    a)Write a parser for the language you've designed. You are allowed to modify the grammar and language but be            prepared with the justifications for the changes you make. Your parser should identify the multiple syntax             errors.

    b)Write a program to display the syntax tree corresponding to a syntactically correct program.

    Assignment 04 Due on April 6th
    
    In this assignment modify your parser to produce the MIPS machine codes in case of syntactically correct programs.     You can break it into 3 smaller assignments

    a) Modify the parser to produce the MIPS code assuming that the program is a simple program without branching statements or loops or function calls.

    b) Add branching statements and loops to the language.

    c) Add function calls.
